This is a Python implementation of the classic Ludo game.

How to Play
The game is played by 2 to 4 players, each with 4 tokens. The players take turns rolling a dice and moving their tokens around the board, with the goal of getting all 4 tokens to the home square before the other players.

The game board consists of a cross-shaped path with 4 different colors, one for each player. Each player's tokens start in their respective starting area and move clockwise around the board.

A token can only move onto the board by rolling a 6. Once on the board, the token moves the number of spaces indicated by the roll of the dice. If a player rolls a 6, they get to roll again.

If a player's token lands on a square already occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent's token is sent back to their starting area. However, a player's own tokens cannot be captured.

When a player rolls a 6, they get to move a token out of their starting area and onto the board. If they roll 3 consecutive 6's, they must skip their turn.

If a player lands on a star square, they get an extra turn. If they land on a globe square, they must move their token to the next globe square of the same color.

The game ends when one player gets all 4 of their tokens to the home square.

Requirements
This game requires Python 3.7 or later to run.

Usage
To start the game, simply run the ludo.py file in your Python environment:

Copy code
python ludo.py
Follow the prompts to enter the number of players and their names.

The game is played in the terminal, with each player taking turns rolling the dice and entering the number of the token they wish to move.

Good luck and have fun!
